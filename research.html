We study gene regulatory mechanisms using skeletal muscle cells and cancer cells as model systems. Currently the main focus of her group is to study the functional roles of non-coding RNAs in regulating gene expression in skeletal muscle stem cells and muscle regeneration.</p>

<h2 id="Understanding the functional roles of non-coding RNAs in muscle stem cells and skeletal muscle regeneration">Understanding the functional roles of non-coding RNAs in muscle stem cells and skeletal muscle regeneration.</h2>
<p>Previously, the majority of the human genome was thought to be "junk" DNA with no functional purpose. Over the past decade, evidence from numerous
    high-throughput genomic platforms reveals that even though &lt;2% of the mammalian genome encodes proteins, a significant fraction can be transcribed into
    different complex families of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Growing evidence supports that ncRNAs have fundamental roles as regulators of genomic output. Among
    various types of ncRNAs, microRNAs have dominated the current literature. Other groups, however, such as long ncRNAs (lncRNAs, &gt;200nt), have been
    largely under explored.</p>
<p>
    The genesis of skeletal muscle during embryonic development and postnatal life serves as a paradigm for stem and progenitor cell maintenance, lineage
    specification, and terminal differentiation. Because of the early discovery of the myogenic factor that act downstream, the muscle stem cell
differentiation is extensively studied. It is a powerful system for investigating the biological functions of ncRNAs, because it can be both recapitulated    <em>in vitro</em> using a C2C12 murine myoblast cell line and because the transcriptional networks coordinating gene expressions are extensively studied.
    In recent years, compelling evidence has integrated miRNAs into this complex hierarchy of the muscle transcriptional network. However, the roles of lncRNAs
    are largely unexplored.

    <h3>microRNA research:</h3>
</p>
<p>
    In the past few years, we have extensively characterized the functional roles of miRNAs in skeletal muscle differentiation and muscle related diseases.
    Specifically, we have (1) functional characterized the roles of miR-29 in myogenesis and Rhabdomyosarcoma and identified a NF-kB-YY1-miR-29 regulatory
    circuitry; (2) investigated the function of miR-29 in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the use of miRNA replacement therapy for DMD treatment; (3)
    Elucidated a YY1-miR-1 regulation during myoblast differentiation; (4) Identified Rybp as a novel co-regulatory factor of YY1 during myogenesis; (5)
    Studied the TGF-beta regulation on miR-29 during muscle fibrogenesis.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>lncRNA research:</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Recently, we started exploring the roles of lncRNAs in muscle stem cells and muscle regeneration. Several on-going projects include: (1) Functional
    characterization of lncRNAs in muscle cell differentiation and muscle regeneration; (2) Discovery of novel lncRNAs in skeletal muscle and other systems
    using an integrated high throughput RNA-seq and computational analysis pipeline; (3) Construction of TF-lncRNA-microRNA regulatory networks in myogenesis.

<h2 id="integrated-measurements">Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Endometrial Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma (EEC)</h2>
<p>Endometrial cancer is the third most common gynecologic malignancy and about 80% of these cancers are endometrial endometriod carcinoma (EEC). The
    molecular mechanisms underlying EEC tumorigenesis is under-explored. (1) We have identified a novel miR-193a-YY1-APC regulatory axis in EEC development;
    (2) We are studying the functional roles of PCDH10 in EEC development.</p>
